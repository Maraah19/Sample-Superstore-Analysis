# *Sample-Superstore-Analysis*
## *Project Overview*
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Sample Superstore dataset using Excel, SQL (SSMS), PowerPoint, and Power BI.
The aim of the analysis is to explore sales performance, customer behaviour, profit distribution, and regional trends to provide meaningful insights that support data-driven decision making.
Through data cleaning, SQL querying, and interactive visualization, this project uncovers the key factors influencing sales and profitability across different categories, segments, and geographic regions.

## *Objectives & Aims*
*The main objectives of this project are:*
-To clean, organize, and preprocess the dataset using Excel.
-To perform SQL queries for deeper analysis and validation of business questions.
-To design a clear and user-friendly Power BI dashboard (with a custom background created in PowerPoint).
-To identify sales trends, profit distribution, and customer purchasing patterns.
-To provide actionable recommendations that can help improve business performance and profitability.

## *Key Metrics & Indicators (KPIs)*
*The dashboard highlights the following metrics:*
-Total Sales
-Total Orders
-Total Customers
-Sum of Discounts
-Sum of Profit
-Sum of Quantity

These KPIs summarize the overall performance of the business.

## *Insights & Findings*
1. *Sales by Segment*
The consumer segment generated the highest Total Sales.

2. *Profit by Categor*y
Technology and Office Supplies produced the highest profits.
Furniture was the least profitable category, with some sub-categories performing negatively.

Standard Class was the most frequently used shipping mode.
This suggests customers prefer cheaper or more accessible shipping options.
4. *Profit and Sales Over Time*
Sales and profit showed noticeable fluctuations across different order dates.
Certain months recorded significant peaks, indicating possible seasonal demand.
Profit trends did not always follow sales trends, suggesting inconsistent margins.
5. *Total Sales by Region*
The West region contributed the highest Total Sales.
The South region had the lowest performance and requires improvement.
Regional differences may be influenced by demographics, pricing, logistics, or local market competition.

## *Recommendations*
1.*Improve Profitability in the Furniture Category*
- Re-evaluate pricing strategy
- Reduce excessive discounting
- Offer product bundles
